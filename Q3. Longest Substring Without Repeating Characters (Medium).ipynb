    "Use a __dict__ to map characters to where they appear (index number) in the given list. <br>\n",
    "The __dict__ helps maintaining a sliding window. Characters in this sliding window are not repeated. <br> \n",
    "The size of this sliding window represents the length of the substring without repeating characters, and is measured by the lower and upper window boundary. <br>\n",
    "- If the currently traversed character never appears in the sliding window:\n",
    "     - Update the sliding window by adding a key-value pair which the key is the currently traversed character, and the value is its index in the given string (also can be represented as the current position of the upper window boundary)\n",
    "     - Expand the upper window boundary right by 1 index.\n",
    "- If the currently traversed character has appeared in the sliding window: \n",
    "     - Update the sliding window by deleting the key-value pair which the lower window boundary are pointing to.\n",
    "     - Narrow the window by moving the lower window boundary left by 1 index.\n",
    "     - Continue to check whether this currently traversed character has appeared in the updated sliding window. \n",
    "- Every time when the sliding window increases, update the longest substring by comparing the historical longest substring length to the current sliding window size.\n",
    "- Repeat the previous steps until either lower or upper window boundary exceeds the input string length.\n",
